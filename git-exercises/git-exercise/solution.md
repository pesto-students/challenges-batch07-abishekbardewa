# Git Exercise insights

got an idea about how git store all data in a object folder with sha1 hash function which points to a tree which points to blob object which store the actual contents of a file.
git reset can be used to reset a staging file.
git stash can be used to save a files which is under work and want to keep main branch clean.
-we can use 'git stash apply <stash-name>' to put back that stash to working branch.
git tag can be very use to mark a specific pointer in commit or branch. It can be use full to mark a stable branch or release to make easy reference.
we can use git merge to merge a other working branch to main branch and make them single branch.
